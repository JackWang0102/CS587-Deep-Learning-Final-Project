# CS587-Deep-Learning-Final-Project

• Developed a BART-based post-processing framework to aggregate multi-chain Metropolis-Hastings samples generated
from Flan-T5 base for text style transfer.
• Demonstrated that summarization-based fusion significantly enhances generation stability over single-point selection.
• Analyzed performance-robustness trade-offs and the impact of proposal model quality on output integrity.
